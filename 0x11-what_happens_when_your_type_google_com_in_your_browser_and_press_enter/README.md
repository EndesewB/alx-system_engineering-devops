A blog that Describes What happens when you type google.com in your browser and press Enter

Introduction: 
When you type "https://www.google.com" in your browser and press Enter, a series of intricate processes unfold behind the scenes, allowing you to access the Google search engine. In this blog post, we will delve into the various steps involved in this journey, including DNS requests, TCP/IP, firewalls, HTTPS/SSL, load balancers, web servers, application servers, and databases.
DNS Request: 
The first step is the Domain Name System (DNS) resolution. The browser sends a DNS request to a DNS server to translate the human-readable domain name, "www.google.com," into an IP address. The DNS server responds with the IP address associated with the domain, allowing the browser to proceed.
TCP/IP: 
Once the browser has obtained the IP address, it initiates a Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) connection with the server at that address. TCP ensures reliable data transmission by breaking the data into packets, numbering them, and reassembling them at the destination.
Firewall: 
At this stage, the browser's request passes through various network firewalls. Firewalls act as a security barrier, They protect against unauthorized access and potentially harmful network traffic.
HTTPS/SSL: 
With the TCP connection established, the browser initiates a secure Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) connection. HTTPS ensures the confidentiality and integrity of data transmitted between the browser and the server. It uses Secure Socket Layer (SSL) or Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols to encrypt the communication, safeguarding it from eavesdropping and tampering.
Load Balancer: 
In many cases, large-scale websites like Google employ load balancers to distribute incoming requests across multiple servers. Load balancers optimize resource utilization and enhance scalability by intelligently distributing traffic. They help maintain high availability and prevent any single server from becoming overwhelmed with requests.
Web Server: 
After passing through the load balancer, the request reaches a web server. The web server software, such as Apache or Nginx, receives and processes the request. It retrieves the requested web page or resource and sends it back to the browser as an HTTP response.
Application Server: 
Application servers execute dynamic code or interact with databases to generate the requested content. They handle complex processing tasks like running server-side scripts or accessing backend systems. The application server processes the request and returns the generated response to the web server.
Database: 
If the requested content relies on data from a database, the application server queries the appropriate database server. The database server retrieves and processes the data before sending it back to the application server. The application server combines the retrieved data with any additional logic to generate the final response.
